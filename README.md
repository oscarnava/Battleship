# 🚢Battle Ships Game

[<img src="docs/board.png" align="left" width="30%">](https://oscarnava.me/battleships/)

A browser-based version of the board game [Battle Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). The game starts with your ships on the board, the number depending on the selected level of difficulty. You can drag them around using the mouse, and double-click to turn it by 90°. Once you are satisfied with your distribution, start the game by initiating an attack by clicking over any empty cell on the computer board.

### Watch me think!

You can even watch in real-time the strategy that the computer is using at that moment. Dark red cells are those where the computer thinks it's more probable to find a ship, and the lighter or white ones are where she thinks it's less probable to hit a ship.
